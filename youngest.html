<p>My youngest brother is six years younger than I. He is on the spectrum. I enjoy watching him try and process things. </p>
<br>
<p> I see my youngest brother playing video games on the TV. What should I do?</p>
<br>
<a href="ignored.html">Ignore him and lay on the living room couch.</a>
<br>
<a href="blocked.html">Mess with him. Block his view by standing in between him and the TV.</a>
<br>
<a href="sit.html">Tell him to sit down. He's standing far too close to the TV. It's gonna hurt his eyes.</a>
<br>
<a href="hug.html">Hug him from behind. This little dude hasn't talked to me all day.</h2>
