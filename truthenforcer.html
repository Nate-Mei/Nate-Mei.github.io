<h1>One of Most Recent Armor Sets</h1>

<img src="truthenforcer.jpg" alt="most recent armor sets">
<p>The Truth Enforcer armor sets have probably one of the best armor perks in this game: Unflinching. This armor perk allows you to aim down your gun without the stagger of enemy attacks, meaning you're basically unbothered by any minor inconvenience. I personally love this perk as it helps me a lot with dealing with pesky enemies with no worries about missing my shots. Also it just looks awesome.</p>
